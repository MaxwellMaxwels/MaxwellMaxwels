## Hi there 👋

I’m **Maxwell**, a **Full-stack Machine Learning Engineer** focused on building **end-to-end ML systems** — from data ingestion and pipelines to model training, deployment, and monitoring.

I’m intentionally combining **Machine Learning** and **Data Engineering**, because models are only as good as the systems that feed, serve, and scale them.

---

### 🔭 What I’m currently working on
- End-to-end ML projects (data → features → model → API → monitoring)
- Data pipelines using tools like **Spark, dbt, Kafka**, and SQL
- Serving ML models via APIs and production-ready workflows

---

### 🌱 What I’m currently learning
- Advanced **Machine Learning Engineering** practices
- **MLOps** (model versioning, CI/CD, monitoring, reproducibility)
- Distributed data processing and scalable systems design

---

### 🧠 Areas of interest
- Full-stack ML systems
- Data engineering for ML
- Model deployment and reliability
- Adversarial & secure ML (offensive and defensive perspectives)

---

### 🤝 I’m looking to collaborate on
- Real-world ML projects with production constraints
- Data engineering pipelines for analytics or ML
- Open-source projects related to ML infrastructure

---

### 💬 Ask me about
- SQL & data modeling
- ML fundamentals and model evaluation
- Designing ML pipelines from scratch
- Bridging data engineering and ML engineering

---

### 📫 How to reach me
- GitHub: you’re already here 🙂
- LinkedIn: *(add when ready)*

---

### ⚡ Fun fact
I care more about **whether a model survives production** than whether it scores 0.2% higher offline.
